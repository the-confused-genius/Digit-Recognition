# Hand Written Digit Recognition  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify the hand written digit
I would be working on two different datasets, both are available in the following libraries 
- 8x8 digit dataset from sklearn &rarr; datasets &rarr; load_digits
- (Mnist dataset) 28x28 digit dataset from sklearn &rarr; datasets &rarr; fetch_openml &rarr; mnist_784
<br>
I have trained the first dataset using the support vector machine, specifically support vector classifier from the sklearn library  <br>
I have trained the second dataset using Logistic Regression and Random Forest which are also from the sklearn library
